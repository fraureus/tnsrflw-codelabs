    "Hi, guys! I'm Justin. I drafted this quick setup guide to help you guys prepare for our upcoming workshop on TensorFlow. I encourage you all to do this as early as possible so we can immediately start with our session.\n",

    "There are actually many ways to install Tensorflow, but for purpose of the workshop, this guide will only show you how to install TensorFlow using Docker. \n",

    "What is this thing called Docker, you might wonder? Docker is a software container tool that will do most of the heavy-lifting and handling of dependencies for us. Any piece of software along with everything it needs to run are packaged into an 'isolated container'. Using that container or image on Docker, the software is guaranteed to run the same way every time, and on any machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Note:\n",
    "> This guide will cover the Docker installation process for Windows only. That means the same instructions might not necessarily work for Mac or Linux. So if you do operate on a different machine, please follow the specific guides for installing Docker on your OS from the respective links below. Once you have the installed Docker successfully, you can start to follow along with the guide from **`Step 2`**.\n",
