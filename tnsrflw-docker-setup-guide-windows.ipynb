    "Hi, guys! I'm Justin. I drafted this quick setup guide to help you guys prepare for our upcoming workshop on TensorFlow. I encourage you all to do this as early as possible, so we can immediately start with our session.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are actually many ways to install Tensorflow, but for purpose of the workshop, this guide will only show you how to install TensorFlow using Docker. Docker will do most of the heavy-lifting and handle the dependencies for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Note:\n",
    "> This guide will cover the Docker installation process for Windows only. That means the same instructions might not necessarily work for Mac or Linux. So if you do operate on a different machine, please follow the specific guides found at the respective links below. Once you have the Docker installed, you can start to follow along from Step 2 part of the guide.\n",

    "## Step 1. Download & Install Docker\n",
    "If you already have Docker installed, you can skip ahead to Step 2 (Install TensorFlow Image with Docker). Otherwise, go download Docker for your Windows version from the links below:\n",

    "> ### Note:\n",
    "> If you happen to to have Git in your machine already, I suggest you uncheck the Git part during the Docker installation and hopefully the installer should be able to locate and map to your existing Git installation. If you don't uncheck it, your machine would re-install Git and it might result to a path conflict.\n",
